Product Roadmap 2026.2.22 

Phase 0: Boundaries and Contracts

slab-core: Freeze the scheduling API (Orchestrator/Pipeline/Stage), define Payload/BackendOp contracts

slab-server: Determine the minimum API (submit/status/stream/cancel/health)

Phase 1: slab-core kernel stabilization (1–2 weeks)
Add a unified error model and state transition testing
Clarify the input/output parameter contracts for GPU/CPU stages
Define the engine-facing worker adapter boundary (BackendRequest/Reply ownership, cancellation rules)

Phase 2: Ultra-thin server MVP (2 weeks)

slab-core: Provide worker/adapter interface specifications

slab-server: Implement the minimum API + task management
slab-core: Introduce payload codecs for typed request/response (first for whisper)

Phase 3: Engine integration and templating (2–3 weeks)

slab-core: Introduce engine adapter structures (ggml/whisper/llama/diffusion)

slab-server: Complete local pipeline orchestration and streaming backhaul
slab-core: Add engine registry + backend_id mapping conventions

Phase 4: Client integration (2 weeks) (Weekly)

slab-core: Provides stable version number and compatibility documentation

slab-server: Provides local daemonization, health checks, and log anonymization
slab-core: Publish minimal compatibility matrix for adapters and runtime

Phase 5: Reliability and Expansion (2 weeks)

slab-core: Configurable queue/rate limiting policies, semantic stabilization cancellation

slab-server: External API (BYOK) integration, fallback, and metric collection
slab-core: Engine contract tests (streaming, cancellation, error mapping)

slab-core Evolution Highlights (Milestones)

M1: Runtime API freeze + basic test improvement

M2: Engine adapter specification + registry

M3: Stable integration with the ggml family

M4: Concurrency, cancellation, and streaming consistency testing

M5: Version compatibility and documentation
M6: Engine contract test suite baseline
